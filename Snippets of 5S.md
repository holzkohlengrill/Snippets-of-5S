<h1>Snippets of 5S</h1>
One could call this tool as the basis in lean management. Unfortunately the implementation process is not always successful. Thus, this implies a completely destabilised system of improvement which  will interfere (in a destructive way) with any other improvement. This document does not intend to revise the whole 5S methodology. It will point out some to the author critical aspects of 5S.

For clarification, I want to list some (partly subjective) statements regarding 5S – what it is and what it is not:

<h2>5S …</h2>
	… is helps creating standards; a standard is NOT a law
	… is NOT just a tool; it is part of the lean philosophy
	… is pointless whether it is not accepted
	… is intended to get work done better (>> focus lies on the employees)
	… provides a basic framework for subsequent improvement
	… as a process is never done (>> continuous improvement).

Common saying: A place for everything and everything in its place (associated with Samuel Smiles, Mrs Isabella Beeton and Benjamin Franklin).

As a remainder: what are the original 5Ses stand for (derived from Japanese):

1. Seiri – Sort
2. Seiton – Simplify
3. Seiso – Sweep
4. Seiketsu – Standardise 
5. Shitsuke – Self Discipline

When pointing towards its implementation I will only pick out some details of these steps which could applied in exactly the same order. Before you start make sure that everyone understands the purpose of 5S (point out that you will do that for THEM, hence they are the heart of the process; notice that they have their chance to get rid of their claims; lead and help them in an active manner during the whole process).

I recommend to do the process as a part of a workshop. Do not choose too big areas for a change at once – increment piecewise. You will notice that the motivation will decrease dramatically after a few hours. Therefore it is important to lead them especially at the very beginning. Otherwise they will be empirically quite disorganised and lost. That is due to the fact that they cannot have the needed experience which they will gather, however, after a view sessions. Again, use their potential absolutely during the first few hours. It might be useful to document the initial and the final result (>> photo). Decide if and how (define quantitative clear traceable rules) to limit private stuff in advance such as plants (!), pictures, … In general, in case you intend to rearrange a certain area, make yourself a concept first and provide based thereof suggestions during the change.

<h2>1. Seiri – Sort</h2>
Eliminate everything you do not need (>> you will be surprised of the result). Seriously, everything means all of it, that is: rejects, unused parts (hidden buffer?!), tools, personal relics, etc. Remove stocks, … Tag objects in case you are unsure whether they are in use; make a list of these objects. It might useful to indicate a date when it will be removed if nobody will claim it (do not choose a person which is directly (!) involved in this area, probably you will choose yourself which is normally fine).
You may ask:
	For what is that part needed? - if unsure, rather remove it or use tagging (see above).
	How often is it used?
	Is there a designated space?
Consider 5-why methodology.

<h2>2. Seiton – Simplify</h2>
Provide stuff to support the improvement process, that is “shadowboards”, cases, mounts, tools, etc.  Keep their work-flow in mind and/or ask them for it. Consider short paths, clear repositories. Determine together quantities and areas.

<h2>3. Seiso – Sweep</h2>
Cleanness means safety. This step supports a kind of revision of steps Seiton and Seiri. A clean working area provides higher motivation during work. Eliminate causes of dirt or lacks of safety. Fix or replace damaged equipment.

>> Schedule what cannot be done right now.

<h2>4. Seiketsu – Standardise</h2>
Do not implement 5S without this step. As a result of PDCA standardisation it keeps the system going and allows further improvements – all the time. Set standards which are realisable. Improve and maintain these standards. Visualise them. Visualise their progress. Note that one goal is that almost everyone should do this work after standardisation (>> polyvalence).

<h2>5. Shitsuke – Self Discipline</h2>
Use Top-Down approach. There will not be any improvement (on the long run) if the management does not live and respect the philosophy and its standards. Do audits. Be aware that theses audits are part of the improvement process and not a tool to penalise the employees. Emphasise and visualise their progress, not failure.
